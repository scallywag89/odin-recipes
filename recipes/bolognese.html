    <ul>
        <li>1 stick of celery</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>150g flat pancetta</li>
        <li>200g minced beef</li>
        <li>200g minced pork</li>
        <li>1 glass of quality red wine</li>
        <li>3 tbsp good quality tomato paste</li>
        <li>200ml chicken stock</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>To serve</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>500g Rigatoni</li>
        <li>Freshly grated parmesan</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely dice the celery, carrot and onion. Slice pancetta
            into small lardons. Put ingredients in the pot with a little olive oil and
            sweat over a medium heat until the vegetables have softened
            and are starting to brown.
        </li>
        <li>Add the minced meat and break apart into smaller pieces with
            the back of a wooden spoon. Cook over a medium-high heat until the 
            meat has browned and there is little liquid left in the pot.
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn the heat to high and add the glass of wine, let bubble until
            the smell of alcohol has disappeared.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dissolve the tomato paste in the hot chicken stock, then add to the 
            pot with the rest of the ingredients. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn the heat to low, and let simmer for 1.5 hours covered.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve over cooked rigatoni, with freshly grated parmesan. Season to taste.
        </li>
