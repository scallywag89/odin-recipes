    <h3>A delicious Roman classic</h3>
    <p>Carbonara is an Italian pasta dish from Rome made with eggs, 
        hard cheese, cured pork, and black pepper. The dish arrived 
        at its modern form, with its current name, in the middle of 
        the 20th century. The cheese is usually Pecorino Romano, 
        Parmigiano-Reggiano, or a combination of the two.
